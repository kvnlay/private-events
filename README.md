# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

This project is part of the Odin project curriculum and is a replica of the core functionalities of eventbrite, which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.


## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```
After that, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
